Theoretical questions
=====================

What would I need to change in the program to make it
work with hebrew letters?
I will need to change the following:
1) in function "run_single_game" I will need change the
   functions that check if input is an english lowercase
   letter to a function that will check if input is hebrew
   letter.
2) in function "choose_letter" I would need to change constant
   NUMBER_OF_LETTERS from 26 to 22.
3) I would need to change functions "letter_to_index"
   and "index_to_letter" to fit hebrew alphabet instead of english
   probably using a dictionary list.
