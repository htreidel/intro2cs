Theoretical questions
=====================

What would my program return for the following calls:
1)  cyclic('abcd','bcda') - function would return an error
    as inputs are of type str and therefor immutable and my
    function contains .remove which works on mutable objects.

2)  histogram(3,[1,2,3,4]) - will return the list [0,1,1] as my 
    function only counts the numbers from 0 to n-1 which is in this
    case: 2, and how many times each number apears on the list, so it
    will simply ignore the 3,4 in the list.

3)  prime_factors(0) - function would return an empty list, because any
    number that equals to or is smaller than 1 would return an empty list.

4)  pairs(2,[0,0,1,1,2,2]) - function would return
    [[0, 2], [0, 2], [0, 2], [0, 2]], thats because 
    function was not meant to deal with cases on number
    repetition, in which case function would pair each "2" to two "0"s,
    which would result in four pairs of [0,2]. [1,1] would not be recieved
    because function eliminates double apearances by checking i < j, which
    would fail in [1,1]
